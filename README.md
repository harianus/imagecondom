# Image Condom

Image condom is an on-the-fly proxy server for images. It can be used for when you want to resize an image without having to resize it.

Credit goes to [@harianus](https://github.com/harianus) and [@larixk](https://github.com/larixk) for creating the original one which served as an inpiration for this one.

## Design

Image Condom uses streams for all three of its functionalities (input, real-time conversion, output). GraphicsMagick was chosen as the image processing binary due to its efficiency in multi-processor environments.

## Usage
